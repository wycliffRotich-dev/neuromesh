# ADR 0002: Starlette TestClient Deprecation Warning

## Status

Accepted

## Context

While introducing API integration tests for the NeuroMesh presentation layer,
the test suite reports the following warning:

```
StarletteDeprecationWarning:
Using `httpx` with `starlette.testclient` is deprecated;
install `httpx2` instead.
```

The warning originates from:

```
.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/fastapi/testclient.py
```

and not from any source file within the NeuroMesh project.

## Decision

No code changes will be made within NeuroMesh to suppress or bypass this
warning.

The project will continue using the officially supported FastAPI
`TestClient` implementation until the FastAPI/Starlette ecosystem fully
adopts the new testing interface.

No modifications will be made to third-party packages installed inside the
virtual environment.

## Consequences

- NeuroMesh source code remains warning-free.
- The warning is acknowledged as an upstream dependency deprecation.
- Future dependency upgrades will revisit this decision.
- No vendor code is modified, ensuring clean and reproducible environments.

- FastAPI TestClient documentation
- Starlette release notes regarding `httpx2`
