AetherGrid takes workloads, matches them against available compute nodes based on resource requirements and constraints, and manages the full lifecycle: queued, scheduled, running, completed, failed, retried. Jobs run through workers registered against nodes, and job execution ownership is enforced through time-bound leases rather than a simple assignment flag.

This isn't an attempt to replace Kubernetes or Ray. It's a deliberate implementation of **Clean Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design** applied to a scheduling problem, where the architectural boundaries are enforced by tests, not just diagrams, and every non-obvious decision is written down as an ADR.

## Why This Exists

Most scheduler side-projects are a single `main.py` script wrapped in a `while True` loop polling an in-memory dictionary. They work fine, right up until you need to swap the persistence engine, add a new constraint type, or figure out why a job silently disappeared, or why two workers picked up the same job at once.

AetherGrid was built around one rule: **the domain logic doesn't know or care where the data lives.** Jobs, nodes, workers, and the allocation algorithm are pure Python with zero infrastructure dependencies. The database is a detail, not the foundation. This project is a concrete demonstration that these architectural patterns aren't just conference-talk vocabulary; they're guardrails that keep a codebase understandable as it grows, and as its correctness requirements get harder.

## Key Capabilities

- **Job lifecycle management**: explicit state transitions (Queued → Scheduled → Running → Completed/Failed) with configurable retry policies and priority-aware scheduling
- **Constraint-aware best-fit allocator**: matches workloads to nodes based on resource requirements and labels, while skipping nodes that are draining or offline
- **Worker registration and heartbeats**: workers register against a node, report liveness, and are marked dead when heartbeats stop
- **Lease-based execution ownership**: when a worker accepts a job, it holds a renewable, expiring lease on that job, so retries, reconnects, and network failures can't result in two workers executing the same job
- **Real subprocess execution with enforced timeouts**: jobs with a command run as real subprocesses, with a two-stage shutdown (graceful `SIGTERM`, then `SIGKILL` after a grace period) if a job overruns its execution timeout
- **Node liveness tracking**: heartbeat-based health checks, automatic detection of offline nodes, and resource reclamation when work fails or nodes disappear
- **Reconciliation with bounded retries**: jobs abandoned by a dead worker or an offline node are reclaimed back to the queue within their retry budget, and fail outright once that budget is exhausted, so a single unhealthy node can't cause a job to be reassigned and abandoned indefinitely
- **Domain event recording**: real lifecycle transitions (`JobCreated`, `JobScheduled`, and growing) are persisted as immutable events, queryable per-job via `GET /jobs/{id}/history`
- **Live dashboard**: submit jobs, register nodes, and watch cluster health, resource usage, and recent job activity in real time

## Architecture

The system is split into four layers, with dependencies pointing inward:

**Domain**: `Job`, `Node`, `Worker`, and `Lease` aggregates enforce their own invariants. The scheduling algorithm and job lifecycle state machine live here as plain Python, with no imports from FastAPI or psycopg. Delete the infrastructure layer entirely and the domain tests still pass.

**Application**: Services such as `ScheduleJobService`/`SchedulerService`, `AssignWorkerService`, `AcquireLeaseService`, and `ClusterHealthService` coordinate domain objects and repositories without embedding business rules that belong one layer down. A `WorkerExecutionLoop` drives a worker through renewing its lease, actually executing its assigned job as a real subprocess, recording the real outcome, and releasing the lease regardless of that outcome. A `ReconciliationLoop` catches the failure modes the happy path can't: crashed workers, expired leases, state left inconsistent by infrastructure failures.

**Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL implementations exist for every repository (`Node`, `Job`, `Worker`, `Lease`, `Event`), written with raw `psycopg` instead of an ORM, a deliberate choice to keep query behavior and transaction boundaries visible rather than abstracted away. `Node`, `Job`, and `Event` additionally have SQLite implementations for local development. Every repository is validated against a shared **contract test suite** run against each backend it supports, so switching between implementations, or trusting that they behave identically, is a tested guarantee rather than an assumption.

**Presentation**: FastAPI endpoints for jobs, nodes, and workers that validate input, call an application service, and return a response. No business logic lives here.

Every non-obvious decision, why domain owns scheduling instead of application, why raw psycopg over an ORM, how job lifecycle transitions are enforced, why leases exist instead of a simple assignment field, why job commands are deliberately not exposed over the public API yet, is documented as an ADR in `/docs/adr`.

---

## A Deliberate Security Decision Worth Naming

The execution engine can run real, arbitrary commands as subprocesses, with real timeout enforcement. `Job.command` and `Job.exit_code` exist on the domain model and are fully tested at the service layer. They are **not** exposed through the public `CreateJobRequest` API, and this is enforced by a test asserting the field's absence from every response, not left as a comment.

Exposing arbitrary caller-supplied commands over an endpoint with no authentication would mean shipping unauthenticated remote code execution. Building the capability correctly and proving it works, while deferring public exposure until authentication exists, was judged a more honest state to ship than either skipping the feature or exposing it prematurely. See ADR 0012.

## Test Coverage

178 tests across domain, application, infrastructure, and API layers:

- Full domain logic coverage: job lifecycle, retry policy, constraint matching, node and worker liveness, lease semantics
- Contract tests proving every repository's in-memory, SQLite (where implemented), and PostgreSQL implementations behave identically, including foreign-key-enforced aggregates such as `Worker` and `Lease`
- Application service tests for every use case, including lease acquisition, renewal, release, reconciliation repair (both the requeue-with-retries-remaining path and the fail-outright-once-exhausted path), and real subprocess execution (including a test that genuinely kills a process that ignores `SIGTERM`, forcing `SIGKILL`)
- Event recording tests proving the correct events fire, in the correct order, for both the scheduled and unschedulable paths
- API-level tests against real FastAPI endpoints

```bash
pytest
```

## Running It

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wycliffRotich-dev/aethergrid.git
cd aethergrid
docker compose up --build
```

This starts the API and a Postgres instance. Run the frontend separately:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

CI runs the full test suite against a live Postgres service on every push. See `.github/workflows`.

---

## What's Next

- Wiring the remaining lifecycle events (`WorkerAssigned`, `LeaseAcquired`, `LeaseReleased`, `JobCompleted`/`JobFailed`, `JobReclaimed`) so the dashboard's event history reflects a job's full story, not just its creation and scheduling
- A live event feed on the dashboard, backed by a new `GET /events` endpoint
- Visibility into workers in the dashboard; worker registration and lifecycle currently have no frontend surface at all
- Hardening the API for public deployment (rate limiting, structured logging, error tracking, authentication), which also unblocks safely exposing real job commands over the public API rather than keeping them internal-only
- Live cloud deployment with CI/CD auto-deploy on merge

---

## Scope

This isn't trying to compete with Kubernetes or Ray at scale. It's a demonstration of how to build a system that stays understandable as it grows: layered correctly, tested honestly, and documented well enough that someone else could pick it up and know exactly why every piece is where it is, including the pieces that are deliberately half-built and marked as such.
