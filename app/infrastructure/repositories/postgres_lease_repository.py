    PostgreSQL-backed implementation of LeaseRepository.

    Uses raw psycopg (no ORM), consistent with
    PostgresNodeRepository, PostgresEventRepository, and
    PostgresWorkerRepository.

    Assumes the referenced worker and job already exist in
    storage; the leases table enforces this via foreign key
    constraints on worker_id and job_id. This mirrors the
    production call path (AssignWorkerService ->
    AcquireLeaseService), where both are always persisted
    before a lease is acquired.
